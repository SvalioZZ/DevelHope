     * Q Example: Print out the numbers 1 to 10
     * A Example: fori
     *
     * Q1: A user inputs their actions into an ATM, they can withdraw, deposit, check balance or exit. What loop should we use?
     * A1: A while loop should be used, with the condition of (money in the bank > 0);
     *
     * Q2: We have a list of 1000 users to send emails to
     * A2: A for each would be perfect, for user in the list, email the user's email address'
     *
     * Q3: We want to print out the first 80 customer names from our bank database
     * A3: fori is the one, in this scenario we will be using System.out.println(customer[i].getName());
     *
     * Q4: We want to read a file 100 lines at a time, without loading the full file into our program
     * A4: a do/while loop should be used, with the condition of while(indexLineFile < 100) do readLine(indexLineFile);
