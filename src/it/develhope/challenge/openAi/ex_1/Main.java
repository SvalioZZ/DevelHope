/**
 * Exercise: File Manipulation
 * You are given a file called input.txt which contains a list of integers. Your task is to read the integers from the file, sort them in ascending order, and write them to a new file called output.txt.
 *
 * Write a Java program that performs the following steps:
 *
 * Read the integers from the input.txt file.
 * Sort the integers in ascending order.
 * Write the sorted integers to the output.txt file.
 * Your program should be able to handle the case where input.txt contains non-integer values or is not found, and should output a useful error message in these cases.
 *
 * Here are some additional requirements for your program:
 *
 * You should use the Scanner class to read from the input.txt file.
 * You should use the Arrays.sort() method to sort the integers.
 * You should use the PrintWriter class to write to the output.txt file.
 * You should use exception handling to handle any errors that may occur while reading or writing to the files.
 * You can assume that the input file contains at most 10,000 integers, with each integer having a value between -10^6 and 10^6.
