     *    2b: The age of a baby in months -> byte same as age exercise above;
     *    2c: Money in a hedge fund in euros -> int, in this case you can arrive to approximately over 2 billions, it
     *        would be enough;
     *    2d: Price of a good in euros on amazon.com -> a float, it would be less heavy than a double, and it can store decimals.
     *    2e: The exact weight of an apple measured by scientific equipment -> a double, if it has to be perfectly measured, it would store properly and
     *        more efficiently than other types.
     *    2f: The number of kilometers from any 2 places in the world -> a float is perfect, it can measure even a 7th decimal, so it's pretty accurate,
     *        and it can store more efficiently than other types, for "kilometers" parameter above.
